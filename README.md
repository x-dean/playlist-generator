# üéµ Playlist Generator

## Overview

This tool analyzes your music library, extracts audio features, and generates playlists grouped by musical characteristics. It supports multiple playlist generation methods (feature-group, time-based, kmeans, cache) and is designed for robust, radio-ready output.

---

## 1. Modes of Operation

You must choose **one** of the following modes for each run:

| Mode                | Short Flag | What it Does                                                                 |
|---------------------|:----------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Analyze Only        |   `-a`     | Analyzes all audio files, updates the feature database. No playlists created. |
| Generate Only       |   `-g`     | Generates playlists from the database. No audio analysis is performed.        |
| Update              |   `-u`     | Regenerates **all** playlists from the database and updates the DB.           |
| Full Pipeline       |   (none)   | Analyzes audio **and** generates playlists in one run.                        |

> **Note:** You must specify one of `-a`, `-g`, or `-u`. If none is given, it defaults to `-a` (analyze only).

---

## Adaptive Parallel Analysis

The Playlist Generator uses an **adaptive, memory-aware worker pool** for audio analysis. This means:

- You can simply run:
  ```sh
  ./run.sh -a
  ```
  and the system will automatically:
  - Estimate the memory needed for each file.
  - Dynamically set the per-worker memory limit for each file.
  - Launch as many parallel workers as your system/container memory allows, without exceeding a safe cap.
  - Avoid out-of-memory errors and maximize throughput.

### Advanced Options

- **MAX_MEMORY_MB**: (default: 8192) The total memory (in MB) allowed for all workers. Set this in your environment or as an argument in `run.sh` if you want to change the default.
- **WORKER_MAX_MEM_MB_FORCE**: If set, this will force a fixed per-worker memory limit (in MB) for all workers, overriding the dynamic calculation.

**In most cases, you do not need to set any options.** The system will adapt automatically. Only set these if you have special requirements or want to tune performance for your environment.

## 2. Playlist Generation Methods

Choose with `-m` or `--playlist_method`:

| Method         | Description                                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| all (default)  | Feature-grouping: robust, musically meaningful playlists (recommended for most users)      |
| time           | Playlists for each time slot (Morning, Afternoon, etc.), split if too long                 |
| kmeans         | Clusters tracks by audio features using k-means, always assigns all tracks                 |
| cache          | Rule-based grouping by feature bins (similar to ‚Äúall‚Äù, fallback for legacy compatibility)  |

---

## 3. Example Commands

### A. Analyze Your Music Library
```sh
./run.sh -a --music_dir=/path/to/music --host_music_dir=/path/to/music --output_dir=/path/to/playlists
```
- Scans all audio files, extracts features, and updates the database.

### B. Generate Playlists (from DB, no re-analysis)
```sh
./run.sh -g --music_dir=/path/to/music --host_music_dir=/path/to/music --output_dir=/path/to/playlists
```
- Uses cached features to generate playlists (default: feature-group method).

### C. Update All Playlists (regenerate from DB)
```sh
./run.sh -u --music_dir=/path/to/music --host_music_dir=/path/to/music --output_dir=/path/to/playlists
```
- Regenerates all playlists from the database and updates the DB tables.

### D. Generate Time-Based Playlists
```sh
./run.sh -g -m time --music_dir=/path/to/music --host_music_dir=/path/to/music --output_dir=/path/to/playlists
```
- Creates playlists for each time slot (e.g., Morning, Afternoon), splitting if the total duration exceeds the slot.

### E. Generate KMeans Playlists
```sh
./run.sh -g -m kmeans --music_dir=/path/to/music --host_music_dir=/path/to/music --output_dir=/path/to/playlists
```
- Clusters tracks by features, always assigns all tracks, fallback to ‚ÄúMixed_Collection‚Äù if needed.

### F. Generate Cache-Based Playlists
```sh
./run.sh -g -m cache --music_dir=/path/to/music --host_music_dir=/path/to/music --output_dir=/path/to/playlists
```
- Groups tracks by feature bins (legacy/alternative to ‚Äúall‚Äù).

### G. Control Minimum Tracks per Genre for Tag-Based Playlists

When using the tag-based playlist method (`-m tags`), you can control the minimum number of tracks required for a genre to generate a playlist using the `--min_tracks_per_genre` option.

- **Purpose:** Avoids creating playlists for rare genres with only a few tracks.
- **Default:** 10 tracks per genre.
- **Usage Example:**

```sh
./run.sh -g -m tags --min_tracks_per_genre 15 --music_dir=/music --host_music_dir=/music --output_dir=/playlists
```

This will only create genre+decade playlists for genres that have at least 15 tracks in your library.

You can adjust the threshold as needed. Genres with fewer tracks will be ignored for playlist creation.

---

## 4. Output

- Playlists are saved as `.m3u` files in your output directory.
- Each playlist is named by its musical characteristics (e.g., `Upbeat_Groovy_C_Major_Bright.m3u`, `TimeSlot_Morning_Part1.m3u`).
- A `Failed_Files.m3u` is created for any files that could not be analyzed.

---

## 5. For Radio Automation (e.g., Liquidsoap)

- Use the generated `.m3u` files as playlist sources:
    ```liquidsoap
    morning = playlist("/path/to/playlists/TimeSlot_Morning.m3u")
    midday = playlist("/path/to/playlists/TimeSlot_Midday.m3u")
    radio = rotate([morning, midday, ...])
    ```
- If a time slot is split (e.g., `TimeSlot_Morning_Part1.m3u`, `TimeSlot_Morning_Part2.m3u`), you can rotate or shuffle these sub-playlists for variety.

---

## 6. Best Practices

- **Analyze first, then generate:**  
  Run `-a` to analyze, then `-g` or `-u` to generate playlists. This is fastest and avoids unnecessary re-analysis.
- **Update regularly:**  
  Use `-u` after adding new music to keep playlists fresh.
- **Choose the right method:**  
  Use `all` for most cases, `time` for dayparting, `kmeans` for experimental clustering, `cache` for legacy compatibility.
- **Check logs:**  
  The tool logs playlist sizes, fallback behavior, and any errors for easy troubleshooting.
- You can limit the memory usage of each worker process using `--worker_max_mem_mb`. If a worker exceeds this limit, it will skip the file and log a warning.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **No playlists generated?**  
  - Check that you used `-g` or `-u`.
  - Check logs for feature extraction issues.
  - Lower the minimum playlist size if your library is small.

- **Playlists too large?**  
  - The tool splits large playlists automatically (default max: 500 tracks).

- **Want more/fewer playlists?**  
  - Adjust `--num_playlists` (for kmeans) or tune feature rules.

---

## 8. Advanced

- **Customizing playlist logic:**  
  Edit `playlist_generator/playlist_generator/feature_group.py`, `kmeans.py`, `cache.py`, or `time_based.py` to change grouping, splitting, or naming logic.
- **Environment variables:**  
  You can set `MIN_PLAYLIST_SIZE` and `MAX_PLAYLIST_SIZE` to control playlist sizes.

## Tag Enrichment (MusicBrainz & Last.fm)

The playlist generator can enrich your music metadata using the MusicBrainz and Last.fm APIs. This helps fill in missing or improve existing genre, year, album, and other tags for your tracks.

### Enrichment Options

- `--enrich_tags` (CLI or run.sh):
  - Enriches tags for tracks that are missing genre or year.
  - Uses MusicBrainz first, then Last.fm as a fallback.
  - Updates the database with new metadata if found.
- `--force_enrich_tags` (CLI or run.sh):
  - Forces re-enrichment for all tracks, even if metadata already exists.
  - Overwrites the metadata in the database for every track.

### Environment Variables

- `LASTFM_API_KEY`: Required for Last.fm enrichment. Set this in your environment or in `run.sh`:
  ```sh
  export LASTFM_API_KEY="your_real_lastfm_api_key"
  ```

### Dependencies

- The `requests` library is required for Last.fm API calls. It is now included in `requirements.txt`.

### Usage Example

```sh
# Enrich only missing tags (recommended for most users)
./run.sh --enrich_tags

# Force re-enrichment and overwrite all tags in the database
./run.sh --enrich_tags --force_enrich_tags
```

You can use these flags with any playlist method (e.g., `--playlist_method tags`).
