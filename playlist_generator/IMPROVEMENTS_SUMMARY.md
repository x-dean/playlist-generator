# Feature Extraction Improvements Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. BPM Extraction and MusicBrainz Query Logic

**Problem**: BPM extraction could be skipped but MusicBrainz wasn't properly queried, leading to missing BPM data.

**Improvements Made**:

1. **Enhanced BPM State Tracking** (`feature_extractor.py`):
   - Added `bpm_extraction_state` dictionary to track:
     - `local_attempted`: Whether local BPM extraction was attempted
     - `local_succeeded`: Whether local BPM extraction succeeded
     - `local_skipped`: Whether local BPM extraction was skipped (e.g., file too large)
     - `external_attempted`: Whether external API lookup was attempted
     - `external_succeeded`: Whether external API lookup succeeded
     - `final_bpm`: The final BPM value used

2. **Improved Logging** (`feature_extractor.py`):
   - Added `_log_bpm_extraction_stats()` function to provide detailed BPM extraction statistics
   - Logs specific scenarios like:
     - âœ“ BPM extraction skipped due to file size, but found via external API
     - âœ“ Local BPM extraction failed, but found via external API
     - âœ“ Local BPM extraction succeeded
     - âœ— BPM extraction failed - no valid BPM found

3. **Better MusicBrainz Integration**:
   - Enhanced `_musicbrainz_lookup()` to check multiple sources for BPM data
   - Checks work attributes, recording attributes, and tags for BPM information
   - Validates BPM values are within reasonable range (60-200 BPM)

### 2. Parallel Processing Batch Halting

**Problem**: Parallel processing could halt between batches due to memory pressure and poor pool management.

**Improvements Made**:

1. **Enhanced Batch Management** (`parallel.py`):
   - Added batch counting and progress tracking
   - Improved pool creation and verification
   - Added health checks for worker processes
   - Better error handling and recovery

2. **Memory-Aware Processing** (`memory_monitor.py`):
   - Added `should_pause_between_batches()` function to check if system should pause
   - Added `get_pause_duration_seconds()` to calculate optimal pause duration
   - Monitors memory pressure, RSS usage, and memory increase since start

3. **Improved Pool Management** (`parallel.py`):
   - Better pool lifecycle management with explicit termination
   - Memory cleanup after each batch
   - Adaptive pause durations based on memory pressure
   - Interrupt handling between batches

## Key Features Added

### BPM Extraction Enhancements

```python
# New BPM state tracking
bpm_extraction_state = {
    'local_attempted': False,
    'local_succeeded': False,
    'local_skipped': False,
    'external_attempted': False,
    'external_succeeded': False,
    'final_bpm': None
}

# Enhanced logging
def _log_bpm_extraction_stats(self, bpm_state, filename):
    # Provides detailed statistics about BPM extraction process
```

### Parallel Processing Improvements

```python
# Memory-aware batch processing
should_pause, reason = should_pause_between_batches()
if should_pause:
    pause_duration = get_pause_duration_seconds()
    logger.warning(f"Pausing {pause_duration}s between batches: {reason}")
    time.sleep(pause_duration)

# Better batch tracking
logger.info(f"ðŸ”„ PARALLEL: Starting batch {current_batch}/{total_batches} with {len(batch)} files")
```

## Benefits

1. **Better BPM Data Quality**: 
   - Clear tracking of BPM extraction success/failure
   - Improved fallback to external APIs
   - Better logging for debugging BPM issues

2. **More Reliable Parallel Processing**:
   - Reduced halting between batches
   - Better memory management
   - Improved error recovery
   - Clear progress tracking

3. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Detailed BPM extraction statistics
   - Better batch transition logging
   - Memory pressure monitoring

## Usage

The improvements are automatically active. You'll see enhanced logging like:

```
BPM Extraction Stats for song.mp3:
  Local attempted: True
  Local succeeded: False
  Local skipped: False
  External attempted: True
  External succeeded: True
  Final BPM: 120.0
  âœ“ Local BPM extraction failed, but found via external API

ðŸ”„ PARALLEL: Starting batch 2/5 with 8 files
ðŸ”„ PARALLEL: Pausing 10s between batches: Memory high (85.2%)
```

## Configuration

No additional configuration required - the improvements work with existing settings:

- `MAX_WORKERS`: Controls parallel processing workers
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Controls batch size for parallel processing
- `MEMORY_AWARE`: Enables memory-aware processing (default: false)

## Monitoring

Monitor the logs for:
- BPM extraction statistics for each file
- Batch transition messages
- Memory pressure warnings
- Pool health checks
