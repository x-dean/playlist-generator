# Music Directory Path Fix Summary

## Problem
The Docker container was looking for music files in `/app/music` but the Docker Compose file was mounting the music directory to `/music`, causing a path mismatch.

## Error Messages
```
⚠️ MusiCNN model files not found:
   Model: /app/models/musicnn_model.pb
   Config: /app/models/musicnn_features.json
⚠️ MusiCNN model not available - advanced features disabled
 Music directory does not exist: /app/music
⚠️ No audio files found for analysis
```

## Root Cause
The file discovery code in `src/core/file_discovery.py` was hardcoded to use `/app/music` as the music directory path, but the Docker Compose configuration mounts the music directory to `/music`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Music Directory Path
**File:** `playlist-generator-simple/src/core/file_discovery.py`
- **Line 42:** Changed `self.music_dir = '/app/music'` to `self.music_dir = '/music'`
- This aligns with the Docker Compose volume mount: `- ./music:/music:ro`

### 2. Updated MusiCNN Model Paths
**File:** `playlist-generator-simple/src/core/audio_analyzer.py`
- **Lines 171-172:** Updated default MusiCNN model paths:
  - From: `/app/feature_extraction/models/msd-musicnn-1.pb`
  - To: `/app/models/musicnn_model.pb`
  - From: `/app/feature_extraction/models/musicnn/msd-musicnn-1.json`
  - To: `/app/models/musicnn_features.json`

### 3. Updated Configuration Example
**File:** `playlist-generator-simple/playlista.conf.example`
- Updated MusiCNN model paths to match the new Docker setup
- The actual `playlista.conf` file already had the correct paths

## Docker Compose Configuration
The Docker Compose file correctly mounts:
- `./music:/music:ro` - Music files
- `./models:/app/models:ro` - Model files (optional)

## Verification
Created test script `test_music_path_fix.py` to verify the fix:
- ✅ Configuration loads correctly
- ✅ Music directory path is set to `/music`
- ✅ MusiCNN model paths are set to `/app/models/`
- ⚠️ Model files not found (expected if not provided)

## Result
The application now correctly looks for:
- Music files in `/music` (mounted from `./music`)
- Model files in `/app/models` (mounted from `./models`)

This resolves the "Music directory does not exist" error and allows the application to find audio files when running in Docker.
