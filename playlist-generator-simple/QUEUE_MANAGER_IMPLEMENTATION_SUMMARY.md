# Queue Manager Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive queue manager for parallel processing that addresses the user's request for "implement queue manager for parallel processing" while building upon the previous memory fixes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Queue Manager (`src/core/queue_manager.py`)

**Key Components:**
- **QueueManager Class**: Main orchestrator for parallel processing
- **ProcessingTask Class**: Individual task representation with priority support
- **TaskStatus Enum**: Comprehensive status tracking (PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED, RETRY, CANCELLED)
- **QueueStatistics Class**: Real-time performance monitoring

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Priority-based task queuing (higher priority processed first)
- ✅ Automatic retry mechanism (configurable retry count and delay)
- ✅ Progress monitoring with custom callbacks
- ✅ Memory-aware worker management (dynamic worker adjustment)
- ✅ Database integration for persistent state
- ✅ Real-time status updates and statistics
- ✅ Global instance management

### 2. Integration with Analysis Manager (`src/core/analysis_manager.py`)

**Integration Points:**
- Modified `analyze_files()` method to use queue manager for small files
- Added `_get_analysis_config()` helper method
- Seamless fallback to direct parallel processing if queue fails
- Progress reporting through analysis manager

**Benefits:**
- Automatic file categorization (small vs large files)
- Queue-based processing for small files
- Maintains existing analysis manager interface
- Enhanced error handling and monitoring

### 3. Memory Management Integration

**Memory-Aware Features:**
- Per-worker memory limits (256MB)
- Available memory checks (300MB minimum)
- Dynamic worker reduction under memory pressure
- Forced garbage collection between batches
- Memory monitoring and alerts

**Integration with Previous Memory Fixes:**
- Uses same memory limits from parallel_analyzer.py
- Consistent memory thresholds and monitoring
- Compatible with resource manager optimizations

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Priority-Based Processing
```python
# High priority task (processed first)
high_priority_id = queue_manager.add_task("/path/to/important.mp3", priority=10)

# Normal priority task
normal_priority_id = queue_manager.add_task("/path/to/normal.mp3", priority=5)

# Low priority task (processed last)
low_priority_id = queue_manager.add_task("/path/to/low.mp3", priority=1)
```

### 2. Automatic Retry Mechanism
- Configurable retry count (default: 3)
- Exponential backoff with retry delays
- Priority reduction on retry
- Comprehensive error tracking

### 3. Progress Monitoring
```python
def progress_callback(stats):
    progress = (stats['completed_tasks'] + stats['failed_tasks']) / stats['total_tasks'] * 100
    print(f"Progress: {progress:.1f}% ({stats['completed_tasks']}/{stats['total_tasks']})")

queue_manager.start_processing(progress_callback)
```

### 4. Memory-Aware Resource Management
- Dynamic worker adjustment based on memory usage
- Memory monitoring every 30 seconds
- Automatic worker reduction when memory > 90%
- Garbage collection between batches

## Testing and Validation

### Test Script (`test_queue_manager.py`)
**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Basic queue manager functionality
- ✅ Integration with analysis manager
- ✅ Advanced features (priority, retries)
- ✅ Memory management
- ✅ Global instance management

**Test Results:**
- All tests pass successfully
- Queue manager properly handles task prioritization
- Memory management features working correctly
- Integration with analysis manager seamless

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from core.queue_manager import get_queue_manager

# Get global queue manager instance
queue_manager = get_queue_manager()

# Add files to queue
task_ids = queue_manager.add_tasks([
    "/path/to/audio1.mp3",
    "/path/to/audio2.mp3",
    "/path/to/audio3.mp3"
])

# Start processing
success = queue_manager.start_processing()

# Monitor progress
while True:
    stats = queue_manager.get_statistics()
    if stats['pending_tasks'] == 0 and stats['processing_tasks'] == 0:
        break
    time.sleep(1)

# Stop processing
queue_manager.stop_processing()
```
