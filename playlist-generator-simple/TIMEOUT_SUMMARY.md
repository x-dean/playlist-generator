# Timeout Summary for Analysis Steps

## Overview
Added individual timeouts to each analysis step to prevent hanging and ensure graceful failure handling.

## Timeout Configuration

### **Feature Extraction Timeouts**

| Feature | Timeout | Reason |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Rhythm Features** | 5 minutes | BPM analysis can be computationally intensive |
| **Spectral Features** | 2 minutes | Centroid, rolloff, flatness calculations |
| **Loudness Features** | 1 minute | RMS and dynamic complexity analysis |
| **Key Detection** | 3 minutes | Chroma analysis and key detection |
| **MFCC Features** | 4 minutes | Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients |
| **MusiCNN Features** | 10 minutes | Deep learning model inference |

### **Metadata and API Timeouts**

| Step | Timeout | Reason |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Metadata Extraction** | 30 seconds | File tag reading |
| **External API Enrichment** | 1 minute | MusicBrainz and LastFM API calls |

### **Overall Analysis Timeout**

| File Size | Timeout | Reason |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Small Files** | 10 minutes | Standard analysis |
| **Large Files** | 20 minutes | Extended processing |
| **Extremely Large Files** | 30 minutes | Maximum processing time |

## Implementation Details

### **Timeout Decorator**
```python
@timeout(seconds, error_message)
def method_name():
    # Analysis code
```

### **Cross-Platform Support**
- **Unix/Linux**: Uses `signal.SIGALRM`
- **Windows**: Uses threading-based timeout

### **Error Handling**
- Individual feature timeouts don't stop entire analysis
- Failed features get invalid markers (`-999.0`, `'INVALID'`)
- Successful features are still extracted
- Analysis continues with next feature

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Hanging**: No single step can hang indefinitely
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Failed features don't stop analysis
3. **Resource Management**: Prevents excessive CPU/memory usage
4. **Predictable Performance**: Known maximum times for each step
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Unix and Windows

## Example Timeout Behavior

```
21:54:52 - INFO - Feature extraction step: rhythm | SUCCESS | 19.512s
21:55:11 - INFO - Feature extraction step: spectral | SUCCESS | 0.301s
21:55:12 - INFO - Feature extraction step: loudness | SUCCESS | 0.340s
21:55:12 - WARNING - ‚ö†Ô∏è Key feature extraction timed out
21:55:12 - INFO - Feature extraction step: key | FAILED | 180.0s
```

In this example:
- ‚úÖ Rhythm, spectral, loudness completed successfully
- ‚ùå Key detection timed out after 3 minutes
- üîÑ Analysis continues with remaining features
- üìä Final result includes successful features + invalid markers for failed ones
