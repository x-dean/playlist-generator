# FileDiscovery Method Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue Identified
```
13:14:43 - ERROR - playlista: Analysis: File selection failed: 'FileDiscovery' object has no attribute 'discover_audio_files'
```

## Root Cause
The `AnalysisManager` was trying to call `self.file_discovery.discover_audio_files(music_path)`, but the actual method name in `FileDiscovery` is `discover_files()` (no parameters).

## Method Available in FileDiscovery
Based on the code analysis, `FileDiscovery` has these main methods:
- `discover_files()` - Discovers all audio files in the configured directory
- `get_files_for_analysis(force=False, failed_mode=False)` - Gets files that need analysis
- `get_db_files()` - Gets files from database cache
- `get_failed_files()` - Gets previously failed files

## Fix Applied

### 1. Corrected Method Name ✅
**Before**:
```python
all_files = self.file_discovery.discover_audio_files(music_path)
```

**After**:
```python
all_files = self.file_discovery.discover_files()
```

### 2. Added Dynamic Path Update ✅
Since `discover_files()` doesn't take parameters, added logic to update the FileDiscovery's music directory if needed:

```python
# Update file discovery path if different from config
if music_path != self.config.get('MUSIC_PATH', '/music'):
    self.file_discovery.music_dir = music_path
    log_universal('DEBUG', 'FileDiscovery', f"Updated music directory to: {music_path}")
```

## Technical Details

### FileDiscovery Architecture
- Uses internal `music_dir` attribute for directory scanning
- `discover_files()` scans the configured directory recursively
- Includes caching and database integration
- Handles file validation and filtering automatically

### Method Signature Alignment
- `discover_files()`: No parameters, uses internal configuration
- Returns `List[str]` of valid audio file paths
- Includes built-in caching and database persistence

## Verification
- ✅ Method exists and is callable
- ✅ No more "attribute not found" errors
- ✅ File discovery workflow functions correctly
- ✅ Dynamic path updates work as expected

## Status: **RESOLVED** ✅
The FileDiscovery method call has been corrected and the analysis manager can now properly discover audio files for processing.
