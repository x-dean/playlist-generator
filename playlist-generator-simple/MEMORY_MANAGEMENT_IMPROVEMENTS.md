# Memory Management Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to prevent memory saturation during audio processing.

## Problem Identified

The original implementation showed consistent memory usage at 69.5% (10.3GB / 15.5GB) across hundreds of chunks, indicating that audio data was accumulating in RAM instead of being properly released. This memory saturation prevented efficient processing of large audio files.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **High Memory Threshold**: Original threshold was 90%, but memory was already saturated at 69.5%
2. **Insufficient Garbage Collection**: Single `gc.collect()` calls weren't effectively freeing memory
3. **No Memory Pressure Detection**: System couldn't adapt to high memory usage
4. **No Critical Memory Handling**: No mechanism to handle extreme memory situations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Aggressive Memory Management

**Before**: Single garbage collection at 90% threshold
```python
if current_memory['percent_used'] > 90:
    gc.collect()
```

**After**: Multi-level memory management
```python
# Handle critical memory situations
if current_memory['percent_used'] > 85:
    self._handle_critical_memory()
# More aggressive memory management - trigger GC at 70% instead of 90%
elif current_memory['percent_used'] > 70:
    self._force_memory_cleanup()

# Always force garbage collection after each chunk
gc.collect()
```

### 2. Enhanced Memory Cleanup Function

```python
def _force_memory_cleanup(self):
    """Force aggressive memory cleanup to prevent saturation."""
    import gc
    import sys
    
    # Force multiple garbage collection cycles
    for _ in range(3):
        gc.collect()
    
    # Clear any cached references
    if hasattr(sys, 'exc_clear'):
        sys.exc_clear()
    
    # Force memory cleanup
    gc.collect()
```

### 3. Memory Pressure Detection

```python
def _check_memory_pressure(self) -> bool:
    """Check if system is under memory pressure."""
    current_memory = self._get_current_memory_usage()
    return current_memory['percent_used'] > 75  # Memory pressure threshold

def _adjust_for_memory_pressure(self, chunk_duration: float) -> float:
    """Dynamically adjust chunk duration based on memory pressure."""
    if self._check_memory_pressure():
        # Reduce chunk duration by 50% under memory pressure
        adjusted_duration = chunk_duration * 0.5
        return max(adjusted_duration, MIN_CHUNK_DURATION_SECONDS)
    return chunk_duration
```

### 4. Critical Memory Handler

```python
def _handle_critical_memory(self):
    """Handle critical memory situations by pausing and forcing cleanup."""
    import time
    
    logger.error(f"ðŸš¨ CRITICAL MEMORY USAGE! Pausing processing for cleanup...")
    
    # Force aggressive cleanup
    self._force_memory_cleanup()
    
    # Wait a moment for cleanup to take effect
    time.sleep(1)
    
    # Check memory again
    current_memory = self._get_current_memory_usage()
    logger.info(f"ðŸ“Š Memory after cleanup: {current_memory['percent_used']:.1f}%")
    
    if current_memory['percent_used'] > 85:
        logger.error(f"ðŸš¨ Memory still critical after cleanup!")
```

## Memory Management Tiers

### Tier 1: Normal Processing (0-70%)
- Standard processing with regular garbage collection
- No memory pressure detected

### Tier 2: High Memory Usage (70-85%)
- Triggers aggressive memory cleanup
- Forces multiple garbage collection cycles
- Logs warning messages

### Tier 3: Critical Memory (85%+)
- Pauses processing temporarily
- Forces comprehensive memory cleanup
- Waits for cleanup to take effect
- Logs critical error messages

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Memory Saturation**: Aggressive cleanup prevents accumulation
2. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjusts chunk sizes based on memory pressure
3. **Critical Situation Handling**: Pauses processing when memory is critical
4. **Better Monitoring**: More frequent and detailed memory logging
5. **Multiple Cleanup Cycles**: Ensures thorough memory release

## Expected Results

- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Should see memory usage decrease after cleanup
- **Stable Processing**: Memory should remain below 70% during normal operation
- **Better Performance**: Smaller chunks under memory pressure
- **Critical Alerts**: Clear warnings when memory usage is dangerous

## Monitoring

The system now provides detailed memory monitoring:
- Memory usage logged every 5 chunks
- Aggressive cleanup triggered at 70%
- Critical memory handling at 85%
- Dynamic chunk size adjustment under pressure

This should resolve the memory saturation issue you observed with the consistent 69.5% memory usage across hundreds of chunks.
